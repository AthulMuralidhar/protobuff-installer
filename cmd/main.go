// - make a cmd line interface to install protobuf and protobuf compiler
// - so the program should have an interactive interface which asks for the protobuf version and the language and the arch etc, all the important stuff
// - same with the protoc compiler, version arch full or partial etc
// - if left empty, just used the latest and install
// it should also install everything at the usr level without sudo perms unless explicitely mentioned
